# ðŸ“• The Book of Terminology

I created this project with the purpouse of being an universal terminology research.

For this project I choose *Nuxt 3* with *Nuxt Content V2* so I could generate .md files to build the content

All the content of .md files was generated using [ChatGPT 4](https://chat.openai.com)

Feel free to clone this project, implement new ideas that could be useful and give feedbacks too. 

This is my first open project.
